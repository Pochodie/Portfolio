            My name is Daniel Stagno and I am 43 years old. I studied piano for ten
            years at university level to become a professional concert pianist. I
            started my professional studies at Malmö music conservatory where I
            studied under the guidance of <abbr>Prof.</abbr> Hans Pålsson. After
            graduating in 2007 to earn my first master's degree, I continued my
            studies at the Sibelius-Academy in Helsinki where I studied under the
            guidance of Hamsa Al-Wadi Juris. During 2009-2010 I was an Erasmus
            student at the swiss italian conservatory in Lugano where I studied
            piano and chamber music under the guidance of Alessandro D'Onofrio.
            <br />
            <br />
            In addition to performing music of the great composers, such as Bach,
            Beethoven, Chopin and Rachmaninov, I am also composing music on my own.
            I have composed over 50 songs that have been performed not only in
            Sweden, but in many other European countries as well as in the United
            States.
            <br />
            At the moment I am working on a concerto for piano and orchestra as well
            as a set of variations based on the famous Swedish christmas song
            <q>Tre Pepparkaksgubbar</q> by Alice Tegnér.
            <br />
            <br />
            Last year I became increasingly interested in programming and I am
            currently working on a video game simulating <abbr>ATC</abbr><small>(Air Traffic Control)</small>. This game
            is
            being
            made using the
            MonoGame framework in C# and it's a very challenging project for a
            single developer! After working almost 1000 hours on the project, I
            decided to take an introductory course in C# at Luleå University of
            Technology. I was able to finish the course in less than one month, but
            even though the assignments felt quite easy I learned many things during
            the course.
            <br />
            <br />
            At the moment I am studing an introductory course in JavaScript at
            Kristianstad University. Having worked only occassionally with HTML and
            CSS, this course is much more challening!
            <br />

            music as well as to read more about my current projects!
